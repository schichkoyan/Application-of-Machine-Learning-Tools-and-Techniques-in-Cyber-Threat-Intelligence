# Application of Machine Learning Tools and Techniques on Cyber Threat Intelligence

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning system designed to detect cyber threats using the HIKARI-2021 dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is HIKARI-2021. Due to size constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download the dataset from the following links:

- [Download HIKARI-2021 Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/5199540)

## Project Structure

- **Final Code.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that walks through each step of the project, from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Final Code.pdf**: A PDF export of the Jupyter Notebook for easy reference.
- **Final Code.html**: An HTML export of the Jupyter Notebook, offering a web-based format for reviewing the code and results.
- **data/**: Directory where the downloaded dataset should be placed.
- **plots/**: Directory for saving generated plots and visualizations (optional, as results are included in the notebook).

## Running the Code

1. **Download the Dataset**: After downloading, place the dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open `Final Code.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially. This will run the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

3. **View Results**:
   Results can be saved in the `plots/` directory if desired. However, all results, including visualizations, will be available directly within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

The project results, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, are detailed in the notebook. Visualizations like confusion matrices and feature importance plots are also included.
